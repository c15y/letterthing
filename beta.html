        Looks like you found the link to the Letter Thing BETA site, either on purpose or due to boredom and over-clicky obsessive behavior.  Either way, keep in mind that the link below leads to a highly unstable development environment, which means anything goes: bugs, slowness, weird data, profanity, etc.
        <p>
        The development servers go to sleep after a certain duration of inactivity, and they're slower than the mail, so you may need to give them a minute or two to warm up.  While they come awake, they spit out half-drawn pages and say rude things like "Application Error," "Cannot GET /" and such.  Be patient.  Even then, be patient some more.  Probably a good way to be, anyway.

        Letter Thing is open-source and you can contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/c15y/letterthing">project on GitHub</a>.  The server's implemented on Node.js through Express.js, backed by MongoDB through Mongoose and S3 for images, and the client's using AngularJS.  The so-called MEAN stack.  Currently hosted on Heroku, MongoLab and Amazon.  If that makes sense to you, we encourage you to contribute.
