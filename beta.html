        Looks like you found the link to the Letter Thing BETA site, either on purpose or due to boredom and over-clicky obsessive behavior.  Either way, keep in mind that you're accessing a highly unstable development environment, which means anything goes: bugs, slowness, weird data, profanity, etc.
        <p><p>
        The development servers go to sleep after a certain duration of inactivity, and they're slower than the mail, so you may need to give them a minute or two to warm up.  While they come awake, they spit out half-drawn pages and rude things like "Application Error" and such.  Be patient.  Even then, be patient some more.  Probably a good way to be, anyway.

        <p>
        Letter Thing is open-source and you can contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/c15y/letterthing">project on GitHub</a>.  The server's implemented on Node.js backed by MongoDB through Mongoose and S3 for images, and the client's using AngularJS.  Currently hosted on Heroku, MongoLab and Amazon.

        So it's all JavaScript, which has finally arrived as a viable full-stack language.  This project would've taken more time and required more coding if done in Java or even Scala.  So there's that.
