          c15y (pronounced "see-fifteen-why") stands for countertechnology:

          "c" + 15 letters + "y"

          Countertechnology is the application of technology for reducing the harmful effects of technology.

          To get along in society everyone must conform to the machine interface, to behave like a machine themselves in order to get along with the machines.  We move at the hyperspeed pace of technology, which ironically wastes our time with constant distractions.  Online services, especially social media, vie for our attention, pushing information to influence what we should like, what we should read, what we should do, when, and with whom.

          c15y is countering this trend by creating some special technologies to help people live life on their terms, matching the form and cadence of the human interface.  One important principle of countertechnology is reintermediation: putting a human mediator between you and the machine to serve as a helper, a messenger, a guide or just a shield.

          With c15y's flagship effort, <a href='letterthing.com">Letter Thing</a>, c15y is reviving the lost art of postal letter writing and the helpful operator of the early days of telephony ("How can I direct your letter?") to deliver a new way of communicating over the internet that involves slowing down and writing a letter instead of keeping up with the latest trends.  You can get letters mailed back in reply, too, creating an open and direct channel of communication between you and any other group of people without ever needing to turn on a computer.

          c15y is an asymmetric think tank and R&D lab located in a heavily-armed and brick-reinforced redoubt in Eastern Oregon.
