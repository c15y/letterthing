        <h1>What is Letter Thing?</h1>
        <p>
        Mail letters and have them posted to family and friends over email, Facebook, Twitter or just about anywhere online, where they can respond by mailing letters back to you.
        <p>
        Grandma can write to the family using her favorite stationery, and the family can read her letters online and respond with a combined letter of their own, including pictures.
        <p>
        An adventurer hiking the Pacific Crest Trail can update her blog without needing to find an internet cafe or turn on a phone.
        <p>
        Letter Thing mediates online social media for the writer, traveller, artist or anyone who wishes to live life at human speed, on their own terms.
        <p>
        Letter Thing is new, and there's nothing else like it.

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>
        Mail a letter to any Letter Thing office and we'll scan it and post it to letterthing.com, Facebook and other online sites for free.  Tell your recipients to visit letterthing.com to find your letters and subscribe to them.  We can do a lot more than that if you include a cover sheet and a tip (see below).

        <h1>Replies</h1>
        <p>
        If you want a reply, include a return address on your envelope, or for privacy specify one on the cover sheet.  Replies to your letter cost a fee.  The amount depends on the number of pages in the reply, and the available forms of payment depend on whether you're including funds in your letter or someone is paying online.
        <p>
        You can calculate the cost of letters mailed out by counting each part of the letter.  The envelope consitutes one part, postage a second part, each page is a part and paying online counts as an additional part.  Every letter consists of at least three parts.  Each part costs $0.50, or 1 forever stamp if included with your letter.  That's it.
        <p>
        If you include payment in your letter, you can pay by check or using USPS forever stamps, currently sold at the post office for $0.49 each.
        <p>
        By check, replies cost $1.50 for the first page plus $0.50 for each additional page.  We do not publish scans of checks.  Your reply will be delayed until your check clears with the bank.
        <p>
        Using forever stamps, replies cost 3 stamps for the first page plus 1 stamp for each additional page.  Yes, you save a few cents using forever stamps.  You can include up to five stamps in each letter you mail to us.  Make sure the stamps are new and in usable condition, with their backing intact.
        <p>
        If paying online, mailing letters costs $2.00 for the first page and $0.50 for each additional page, payable by credit card or bitcoins.
        <p>
        Letter Thing holds a balance, positive or negative, for the letters we print and mail.  If you send less than the amount due for a reply, we'll print and mail the pages you have paid for and hold the rest with a negative balance (with absolutely no penalties).  To receive the remaining pages, you can send more funds or anyone can pay them online.
        <p>
        If you send more than the amount due, Letter Thing will hold the balance and draw from those funds for letters mailed to you in the future.  If you plan on using Letter Thing more than once, we recommend keeping a balance.  You can ask for the positive remainder of your balance to be included in a check with your reply using a cover sheet (see below).

        <h1>Cover Sheet</h1>
        <p>
        Optionally include a cover sheet with handling instructions for the Letter Thing operator.  Address it to the operator ("Dear Operator," or whatever you favor) and print your name at the bottom with your signature.  Letter Thing does not publish cover sheets addressed to the operator, and your signature serves to confirm your identity in future letters.  You're not signing a contract of any sort.  In fact, your name can be a pseudonym and your signature any scrawled symbol you like.

        <h1>Locks</h1>
        <p>
        To post letters privately, you can lock them with a key and a hint.  A key is a shared password, a private code you share with your recipients so they can unlock your letters online and read them.  You provide a hint along with it to create a lock.  Here's an example:
        <p>
        <em>Please lock this letter using the hint, "My dog's name" and key "Hazel."</em>
        <p>
        You should reuse locks when sending multiple letters, keeping the same hint and key, to make life easier for your readers and yourself.  Use them for broadly categorizing your lists of recipients, if you use them at all.
        <p>
        When verifying keys typed online, Letter Thing ignores punctuation, spaces, numbers and case to make it easier for you to communicate them to your recipients in person or over the phone.  So for the key above, my dog's name, all of the following strings will open the lock:
        <p>
        <em>
          Hazel.<br>
          hazel<br>
          *HaZeL*<br>
          HAZEL<br>
        </em>
        <h1>Print Settings</h1>
        <p>
        Letter Thing always prints color content in full color unless otherwise specified.  By default, we print single-sided using a 12 pt font and include pictures along with text at original size or scaled down to fit the page if necessary.  You can request adjustments to these settings.  To save on pages, you can reduce the font size or discard pictures.  To improve readability, you can increase the font size.  Printing double-sided or in black & white will cost the same.

        <h1>Info Sheet</h1>
        <p>
        Letter Thing includes an info sheet with every letter confirming your settings, summarizing your latest activity and highlighting news and services offered by Letter Thing.

        <h1>Extra Services</h1>
        <p>
        Since Letter Thing operators are humans and not machines, we can offer a range of services beyond routing your letters to the internet and mailing replies.
        <p>
        We can generate and mail custom shopping catalogs if you tell us what you're looking for.  If you find something you like, circle it and include payment, and we'll make the purchase online and have it shipped directly to you.
        <p>
        If you have a special interest or hobby, describe it to us and we'll put together custom newsletters to be mailed to you on a regular basis, with articles and pictures drawn from the internet, including the latest activites of your friends and family.  Tell us what you want and we'll be happy to send you a sample page at the regular rate (1 page = 3 parts), and we'll include rates for subscribing to different formats and delivery schedules.
        <p>
        Just about anything is possible.  Ask us.  And don't forget to tip your operator.
