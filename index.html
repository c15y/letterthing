        <h1>What is Letter Thing?</h1>
        <p>
        Mail letters and have them posted to family and friends over email, on Facebook or just about anywhere you can imagine online, where they can respond by mailing letters back to you.
        <p>
        Grandma can write to all the family using her favorite stationery, and the family can read her letters online and respond with a combined letter of their own, including pictures.
        <p>
        An adventurer hiking the Pacific Crest Trail can update her blog without needing to find an internet cafe or turn on a phone.
        <p>
        Letter Thing mediates online social media for the writer, traveller, artist or anyone who wishes to live life at human speed, on their own terms.

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>
        To use Letter Thing, you mail a letter to a Letter Thing office, and one of our operators will scan and route it to letterthing.com and other online destinations for free, where your recipients can read it, write replies and have us print and mail them back to you.
        <p>
        Include a cover page for the operator with any handling instructions you may have, then sign it and include your phone number.  Your phone number serves as your mailbox number at letterthing.com, and we use your signature to verify the authorship of your letters.  See some sample cover page ideas below.

        <h1>Replies</h1>
        <p>
        If you want a reply, we can use the return address on the envelope, if you provided one, or you can specify an address for replies on the cover page.
        <p>
        Replies mailed back to you cost $1.50 for the first page and postage, then $0.50 for each additional page.  Letter Thing will return the contents of your letter for an additional $1.00
        <p>
        Include a check for at least the cost of the reply you expect.  Replies are printed in 12 point font and can include photos.  Your online mailbox at letterthing.com maintains a balance, and replies mailed back to you draw funds from it.  Anyone can add funds to your mailbox online, including you, of course.
        <p>
        Every reply includes a cover page from Letter Thing listing our current offices and rates as well as your recent activity, current settings and balance.

        <h1>Privacy</h1>
        <p>
        Letter Thing does not pubish cover pages or scans of checks.
        <p>
        You can lock access to your letter online using a single-word passcode.  Specify your chosen passcode on the cover page, and then share the passcode with your intended readers so they can access the letter online.
        <p>
        If you wish to remain anonymous, first mail your letters without a return address.  Then use a (555) area code phone number, since these are reserved.  Or even skip the cover page and we'll post your letter to (555) 555-5555.
        <p>

        <h1>Cover Pages</h1>
        <p>
        Operators are real people who will read your handling instructions on the cover page and carry out just about any service you may want (within reason).  Here are some examples.
        <p>
        Operator,
            <p><p>
