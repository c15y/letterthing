        <h1>What is Letter Thing?</h1>

        Mail letters, color pictures and postcards in the mail and have them posted to family and friends over email, on Facebook or just about anywhere you can imagine online, where they can respond by mailing letters back to you.
        <p><p>
        Grandma can write to all the family using her favorite stationery, and the family can read her letters online and respond with a combined letter of their own, including pictures.  An adventurer hiking the Pacific Crest Trail can update her blog without needing to find an internet cafe or turn on a phone.
        <p>
        Letter Thing mediates online social media for the writer, traveller, artist or anyone who wishes to live life at human speed, on their own terms.

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>

        To use Letter Thing, you mail letters to one of our offices and our operators scan and route them to letterthing.com and other online destinations for free, where your recipients can write replies and have us print and mail them back to you.

        <p><p>
        <em>
        Letter Thing Office<br>
        PO Box XXX<br>
        XXXXX, XX  XXXXX<br>
        </em>
        <p>
        Address the leading page(s) of your letter to the operator, including your phone number at the top, and describe any special handilng instructions you'd like.
        <p>
        "How may I direct your letter?"  Operators are real people who will read your handling instructions and carry out just about any service you may want, as long as it's legal.  See some examples below, and feel free to experiment.
        <p>
        Always provide a valid return address on the envelope.  Letter Thing uses your phone number and verified return addresses together to manage your mailbox.  Falsifying return addresses on US Mail constitutes federal mail fraud, and we'll confirm your return addresses over the phone upon request.
        <p>
        Replies mailed back to you, if desired, cost $1.50 for the first page and postage, then $0.50 for each additional page.  Letter Thing will return the contents of your letter for an additional $1.00; otherwise, we'll shred it.
        <p>
        Include a check for at least the cost of the reply you expect (replies are printed in 12 point font and can include photos).  Your online mailbox at letterthing.com maintains a balance, and replies mailed back to you draw funds from it.  Anyone can add funds to your mailbox online, including you, of course.
        <p>
        Every reply includes a free info sheet from Letter Thing listing our current offices and rates as well as your recent activity, current settings and balance.
        <p>
        Letter Thing does not pubish your return addresses, scans of checks, pages addressed to the operator or the back side of envelopes (where you can put your return address), unless requested.
