        <h1>What is Letter Thing?</h1>
        <p>
        It's the first and only way to access the internet without using a computer or phone.  Mail letters to us and we'll post them to your friends, family or anyone else online, where they can respond by having us mail letters back to you.
        <p>
        Grandma can write to her family using her favorite stationery, and they can read her letters online and respond with a combined letter of their own, including pictures.
        <p>
        An adventurer hiking the Pacific Crest Trail can update her travel blog without needing to hang out in an internet cafe or turn on a phone, and she can pick up replies at her next postal stop.  Even an ultra-light hiker can afford to carry the weight of a pencil and some paper.
        <p>
        A talented sketch artist who doesn't own a computer or smartphone can share his original works online by mailing them to us.  We can send him photos from paying customers online who would like them drawn, along with checks we issue, and we can forward the original sketches to his customers.
        <p>
        That family member with all the coveted recipes can mail us her index cards and we can mail out copies on card stock to her family, then return the originals.
        <p>
        Letter Thing mediates online social media for anyone who wishes to live life at human speed, on their own terms.  We temper the hectic immediacy of always-on social media by reintroducing a social technology that is ancient and slow, yet thoughtful and appreciated -- the letter -- to provide an alternative way to navigate the information age that's more on course with life outside the computer interface.
        <p>
        Letter Thing also provides a publishing platform and marketplace for independent writers, travelers, artists, comic book makers and zine creators.  Publish serially, sending your letters in installments, or all at once.
        <p>
        Some people won't get it.  "Letters take forever!"  Those are the people who can read your letters online and tap out replies on their phones.  Hopefully not while they're driving.

        <h1>Send Letters</h1>
        <p>
        When you mail a letter to any Letter Thing office, one of our operators scans it and uploads it to letterthing.com and Facebook for free.  Then you tell your recipients to visit letterthing.com to read your letters and subscribe to them over email, Twitter and Facebook, which is also free.

        <h1>Cover Sheet</h1>
        <p>
        We can do a lot more than that if you include a cover sheet with handling instructions for the Letter Thing operator.  The cover sheet provides a way for you to communicate with the operator directly and privately, and it's the one component Letter Thing has added to the standard postal conventions to enable internet access in a non-technical way.
        <p>
        Address the cover sheet to the operator ("Dear Operator," or whatever you favor) and print your name at the bottom with your signature.  Letter Thing does not publish scans of cover sheets addressed to the operator, and your signature serves to confirm your identity in future letters.  You're not signing a contract of any sort.  In fact, your name can be a pseudonym and your signature any scrawl you like -- just use them consistently to identify yourself.
        <p>
        We will post your letter along with the name you provide, either taken from the return address section of the envelope, if provided, or given on the cover sheet.  If you provide both, we'll use the name from the cover sheet.  Keep in mind that we post scans of the envelope but not the cover sheet.

        <h1>Replies</h1>
        <p>
        We can mail letters back to you in reply from people and services on the internet, and each letter we send can include replies from multiple people and services.  To get replies, include a return address on your envelope, or for privacy, you can specify your address on the cover sheet.
        <p>
        Replies to your letter cost a fee.  The amount depends on the number of pages in the reply, and the available forms of payment depend on whether you're including funds in your letter or someone is paying online.
        <p>
        You can calculate the price of letters mailed out by counting each part of the letter.  The envelope consitutes one part, postage for each ounce is a part, each page is a part and paying online counts as an additional part.  Every letter consists of at least 3 parts, and each part costs $0.50.
        <p>
        If you include payment in your letter, you can pay by check, cash or USPS forever stamps (and only forever stamps; just called "stamps" here), currently sold at the post office for $0.49 each.
        <p>
        By check, replies cost $1.50 for the first page plus $0.50 for each additional page.  We don't publish scans of checks.  Your reply will be delayed until your check clears with the bank.
        <p>
        You can include cash.  It's legal, and not much of a risk for small amounts.  For larger amounts, you can purchase insurance from the post office for cash up to $5,000.
        <p>
        Using stamps, replies cost 3 stamps for the first page plus 1 stamp for each additional page.  Since forever stamps cost $0.49 each, paying this way saves you at least 3 cents per reply.  What a deal!  You can include up to 10 stamps in each letter you mail to us, and you can mix stamps and check forms of payment.  Make sure the stamps are new and in usable condition, with their backing intact.  As you may have guessed, we use these stamps ourselves to mail letters to you.
        <p>
        If paying online, mailing letters costs $2.00 for the first page and $0.50 for each additional page, payable by credit card or bitcoins.
        <p>
        Letter Thing holds a balance, positive or negative, for the letters we print and mail.  If you send less than the amount due for a reply, we'll print and mail the pages you have paid for and hold the rest with a negative balance (with absolutely no penalties).  To receive the remaining pages, you can mail more funds or anyone can pay for it online.
        <p>
        If you send more than the amount due, Letter Thing will hold the balance and draw from those funds for letters mailed to you in the future.  If you plan on using Letter Thing more than once, we recommend keeping a positive balance so you don't need to send payments with every letter.  You can ask for the positive remainder of your balance to be included in a check with your reply using a cover sheet.

        <h1>Info Sheet</h1>
        <p>
        Like the cover sheet you send us, we include an info sheet with letters we mail out.  It confirms your settings and summarizes your latest activity.  It's doesn't count toward the number of pages in letters we mail out.

        <h1>Sealing Letters with a Secret</h1>
        <p>
        By default, Letter Thing shares your letters to the public openly.  You can optionally seal letters by inscribing a symbol or phrase over the flap on the back of the envelope along with a secret word or phrase on the cover sheet.  We'll require online users to enter the secret words to open and read letters bearing that seal.  To make it easier for you to communicate them verbally without ambiquity, when checking these secrets we ignore punctuation, spaces, digits and case.

        <h1>Print Settings</h1>
        <p>
        Letter Thing always prints color content in full color unless otherwise specified.  By default, we print single-sided using a 12 pt font and include pictures along with text at original size or scaled down to fit the page if necessary.  You can request adjustments to these settings.  To save on pages, you can reduce the font size or discard pictures.  To improve readability, you can increase the font size.  Printing double-sided or in black & white will cost the same as printing single-sided or in color.

        <h1>Tags</h1>
        <p>
        You can provide a list of single-word tags on your cover sheet to characterize your letter, to help people find it online.  Some tags could be: fiction, travel, art and family.

        <h1>Extra Services</h1>
        <p>
        Since Letter Thing operators are real people and not machines, we can offer a range of services beyond routing your letters to the internet and mailing replies.
        <p>
        We can generate and mail custom shopping catalogs if you tell us what you're looking for.  If you find something you like, circle it and include payment, and we'll make the purchase online and have it shipped directly to you.
        <p>
        If you have a special interest or hobby, describe it to us and we'll put together custom newsletters to be mailed to you on a regular basis, with articles and pictures drawn from the internet, including the latest activites of your friends and family.  Tell us what you want and we'll be happy to send you a sample page at the regular rate (1 page = 3 parts), and we'll include rates for subscribing to different formats and delivery schedules.
        <p>
        Online, users can collaborate on writing letters and making greeting cards, and Letter Thing will print and mail them out.
        <p>
        With Letter Thing, just about anything is possible -- the mail will just take a little while.  Ask us.  And don't forget to tip your operator.

        <h1>Beta Testers Wanted</h1>
        <p>
        Letter Thing is new, and there's nothing else like it.  We're currently testing its online functionality, which is hidden from view, but you can start using Letter Thing now by mailing letters to us.  We'll tell you how to find the site in your first reply.
        <p>
        Unlike the usual beta testing process, we'll hold on to your "test data" (your letter scans) after we launch.  We need to load the site with good reading for a general internet audience, and we'd like you to write letters for that audience now.
        <p>
        Replies, even at this early stage, cost a real fee to cover real expenses.  Charging $1.50 (or 3 forever stamps, or $2.00 online) to print and mail you a letter isn't a money-making scheme.  We need to prove that the mailing service is worth the fee and that the amount fairly covers expenses and labor (for both the mailing out of letters <em>and</em> free scanning and routing of incoming letters).  If we find that it's high or low, we'll adjust it, or change the fee structure entirely.
        <p>
        In this regard, Letter Thing beta testers are more like extra-early adopters who should expect outages, missing functionality and serious delays.  And when it comes to mailing letters, delays could mean weeks instead of days.  Sound like fun?
        <p>
        You can share links to the beta site with your friends, and by all means invite them to participate.  By that time, you'll be a real-life Letter Thing letter writer.  Congratulations.
        <p>
        When Letter Thing becomes big and famous, you'll be able to claim OG status.  Now that's the sort of thing that really matters online.
        <p>
        Here's the mailing address of our first Letter Thing Office:
        <p>
        <em>
        Letter Thing<br>
        PO BOX 742<br>
        UNION, OR  97883<br>
        </em>

        <h1>Operators Wanted (Soon)</h1>
        <p>
        Be your own boss, work from home, blah blah blah, and watch out for paper cuts.  You too can start scanning and stuffing letters for pennies a day.
        <p>
        Soon we'll be looking for more owner-operators to open offices.  We know that sounds funny when you say it out loud, but it's the truth.  You just need a stable mailing address and a quality color printer and scanner -- and lots of paper, ink, envelopes and stamps.
