        How does it work?
        <p><p>
        Mail letters to a Letter Thing Office where an operator will scan and route them to letterthing.com and other online destinations for free, where your recipients can write replies and have Letter Thing print and mail them back to you.

        <p><p>
        <em>
        Letter Thing Office<br>
        PO Box 742<br>
        Union, OR  97883<br>
        </em>
        <p>
        IMPORTANT: Always include a leading page addressed to the operator with your phone number and handling instructions.  Also, always provide a valid return address on the envelope.  Letter Thing uses your phone number and verified return addresses together to manage your mailbox.
        <p>
        Replies mailed back to you, if desired, cost $1.50 for the first page and postage, then $0.50 for each additional page.  Letter Thing will return the contents of your letter for an additional $1.00; otherwise, we'll shred it.
        <p>
        Include a check for at least the cost of the reply you expect (replies are printed in 12 point font and can include photos).  Your mailbox at letterthing.com maintains a balance as well as your handling preferences, and replies mailed back to you draw funds from it.  Anyone can add funds to your mailbox online at letterthing.com.  Don't forget to tip your operator.
        <p>
        Every reply includes a free info sheet from Letter Thing listing our current offices and rates as well as your recent activity, current settings and balance.
        <p>
        Letter Thing does not pubish your return addresses, scans of checks, pages addressed to the operator or the back side of envelopes (where you can put your return address), unless requested.  If sending a postcard, don't forget to include your phone number and any handling instructions, and we'll publish both sides unless otherwise requested.  Keep in mind that falsifying return addresses on US Mail constitutes federal mail fraud, and we'll confirm your return addresses over the phone upon request.
