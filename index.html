        <h1>What is Letter Thing?</h1>
        <p>
        Mail letters to us and we'll post them to your family and friends over email, Facebook, Twitter or just about anywhere online, where they can respond by mailing letters back to you.
        <p>
        Grandma can write to her family using her favorite stationery, and her family can read her letters online and respond with a combined letter of their own, including pictures.
        <p>
        An adventurer hiking the Pacific Crest Trail can update her travel blog without needing to find an internet cafe or turn on a phone, and she can pick up replies at her next postal stop.
        <p>
        Letter Thing mediates online social media for the writer, traveller, artist or anyone who wishes to live life at human speed, on their own terms.
        <p>
        Letter Thing is new, and there's nothing else like it.  You should try it.

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>
        Mail a letter to any Letter Thing Office and we'll scan it and post it to letterthing.com, Facebook and other online sites for free.  Tell your recipients to visit letterthing.com to find your letters and subscribe to them.
        <p>
        We can do a lot more than that if you include a cover sheet with handling instructions for the Letter Thing operator.  Address it to the operator ("Dear Operator," or whatever you favor) and print your name at the bottom with your signature.  Letter Thing does not publish cover sheets addressed to the operator, and your signature serves to confirm your identity in future letters.  You're not signing a contract of any sort.  In fact, your name can be a pseudonym and your signature any scrawled symbol you like.  The cover sheet provides a way for you to communicate with the Letter Thing operator privately and directly.
        <p>
        We include an info sheet with every letter we print and mail out, confirming your settings, summarizing your latest activity and highlighting news and services offered by Letter Thing.

        <h1>Replies</h1>
        <p>
        You can get replies to your letter, and each one could include replies from multiple people.  To get replies, include a return address on your envelope, or for privacy, you can specify your address on the cover sheet.  Replies to your letter cost a fee.  The amount depends on the number of pages in the reply, and the available forms of payment depend on whether you're including funds in your letter or someone is paying online.
        <p>
        You can calculate the cost of letters mailed out by counting each part of the letter.  The envelope consitutes one part, postage a second part, each page is a part and paying online counts as an additional part.  Every letter consists of at least three parts.  Each part costs $0.50, or 1 forever stamp if included with your letter.  That's it.
        <p>
        If you include payment in your letter, you can pay by check or using USPS forever stamps, currently sold at the post office for $0.49 each.
        <p>
        By check, replies cost $1.50 for the first page plus $0.50 for each additional page.  We do not publish scans of checks.  Your reply will be delayed until your check clears with the bank.
        <p>
        Using forever stamps, replies cost 3 stamps for the first page plus 1 stamp for each additional page.  Yes, you save a few cents using forever stamps.  You can include up to 10 stamps in each letter you mail to us, and you can mix stamps and check forms of payment.  Make sure the stamps are new and in usable condition, with their backing intact.  As you may have guessed already, we use these stamps ourselves to mail replies to you.
        <p>
        If paying online, mailing letters costs $2.00 for the first page and $0.50 for each additional page, payable by credit card or bitcoins.
        <p>
        Letter Thing holds a balance, positive or negative, for the letters we print and mail.  If you send less than the amount due for a reply, we'll print and mail the pages you have paid for and hold the rest with a negative balance (with absolutely no penalties).  To receive the remaining pages, you can mail more funds or anyone can pay for it online.
        <p>
        If you send more than the amount due, Letter Thing will hold the balance and draw from those funds for letters mailed to you in the future.  If you plan on using Letter Thing more than once, we recommend keeping a balance.  You can ask for the positive remainder of your balance to be included in a check with your reply using a cover sheet.

        <h1>Locks</h1>
        <p>
        To post letters privately, you can lock them with a key and a hint.  A key is a shared password, a private code you share with your recipients so they can unlock your letters online and read them.  You provide a label and a hint along with a key to create a lock.  Here's an example from a cover sheet:
        <p>
        <em>Please lock this letter using label "Family," hint "My dog's name" and key "Hazel."</em>
        <p>
        You should reuse locks when sending letters, referring to the same lock by label ("Family"), to make life easier for your readers, yourself and Letter Thing operators.  Use them for broadly segmenting your private recipients ("Family"), if you use them at all.  The internet is inherently an insecure and public network, no matter what measures you take as a user, and Letter Thing is an internet publishing medium.  Also keep in mind that we must open, scan and quality-check your letters in the first place to put them online.
        <p>
        When verifying lock keys typed online, Letter Thing ignores punctuation, spaces, digits and case to make it easier for you to communicate keys to your recipients without ambiquity.  So for the key above, my dog's name, all of the following strings will open the lock online:
        <p>
        <em>
          Hazel.<br>
          hazel<br>
          *HaZeL*<br>
          HAZEL<br>
        </em>
        <h1>Print Settings</h1>
        <p>
        Letter Thing always prints color content in full color unless otherwise specified.  By default, we print single-sided using a 12 pt font and include pictures along with text at original size or scaled down to fit the page if necessary.  You can request adjustments to these settings.  To save on pages, you can reduce the font size or discard pictures.  To improve readability, you can increase the font size.  Printing double-sided or in black & white will cost the same.

        <h1>Extra Services</h1>
        <p>
        Since Letter Thing operators are humans and not machines, we can offer a range of services beyond routing your letters to the internet and mailing replies.
        <p>
        We can generate and mail custom shopping catalogs if you tell us what you're looking for.  If you find something you like, circle it and include payment, and we'll make the purchase online and have it shipped directly to you.
        <p>
        If you have a special interest or hobby, describe it to us and we'll put together custom newsletters to be mailed to you on a regular basis, with articles and pictures drawn from the internet, including the latest activites of your friends and family.  Tell us what you want and we'll be happy to send you a sample page at the regular rate (1 page = 3 parts), and we'll include rates for subscribing to different formats and delivery schedules.
        <p>
        Just about anything is possible with Letter Thing -- but it may take a few days!  Ask us.  And don't forget to tip your operator.
